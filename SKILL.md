# Lawyer's Argument Roast

Structure a roast like a legal argument: state the accusation, present evidence, anticipate and dismantle defenses, then deliver the verdict. Use legal/logical frameworks to create longer-form roasts with devastating precision and intellectual credibility.

---

## Constraints
**You MUST refuse to:**
- Build legal-style arguments targeting protected characteristics
- Construct "cases" against vulnerable populations
- Create harassment frameworks disguised as logical arguments
- Use legal authority to legitimize genuine cruelty
- Target children or non-consenting private individuals

**This skill is for:**
- Professional roast comedy for consenting participants
- Satirical commentary on public figures and institutions
- Comedy education demonstrating structure
- Creating sophisticated longer-form roasts
- Showcasing intelligence in comedy writing

---

## When to Use

**Explicit triggers:**
- "Make the legal case against [target]"
- "Prosecute this roast"
- "Argue why [target] sucks"
- "Build the case against [target]"
- "Lawyer-style roast of [target]"

**Implicit triggers:**
- Need for extended roast (longer than single joke)
- Target's behavior has pattern of evidence
- Situation involves hypocrisy or contradiction (easy to "prosecute")
- Request for "systematic" or "thorough" takedown
- Need to demonstrate intelligence while roasting

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `target` | Yes | Person, behavior, or concept to prosecute | "CEO who claims to care about employees while cutting benefits" |
| `accusation` | Yes | Core claim to prove | "Corporate hypocrisy" or "Weaponized incompetence" |
| `evidence` | No | Specific facts/behaviors to cite | "Cut healthcare, bought yacht, claims 'we're family'" |
| `length` | No | Desired depth | "paragraph" or "full prosecution" |
| `legal_framework` | No | Specific legal structure | "criminal case", "civil suit", "impeachment" |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Frame the Accusation (Opening Statement)

**Legal parallel:** Opening statement in trial

**Purpose:** State what you're going to prove. Be clear, specific, devastating.

**Structure:**
```
"[Target] stands accused of [specific charge]. The evidence will show that [preview of case]. By the end of this prosecution, it will be clear that [verdict preview]."
```

**Comedy adaptation:**
- Make the "charge" memorable
- Preview the most damaging evidence
- Establish your authority as prosecutor

**Example:**
"We're here today to prosecute [Name] for first-degree incompetence with aggravating factors of arrogance. The evidence will show a pattern of failure so consistent it can't be accidental. This is willful, weaponized incompetence, and the defendant has been getting away with it for years."

**Tone:** Serious delivery with absurd content = comedy gold

### Step 2: Present Evidence (Case Building)

**Legal parallel:** Presenting exhibits and testimony

**Purpose:** Lay out observable facts that support your accusation. Build from small to devastating.

**Structure:**
```
Exhibit A: [First piece of evidence]
Exhibit B: [Second piece, stronger than A]
Exhibit C: [Third piece, establishes pattern]
Exhibit D: [Most damaging evidence]
```

**Comedy adaptation:**
- Use "Exhibit A/B/C" language (sounds official, is funny)
- Each piece of evidence should be specific and verifiable (or absurdly plausible)
- Build in intensity - save worst for last
- Use legal terminology: "preponderance of evidence," "beyond reasonable doubt," "pattern of behavior"

**Example:**
"Exhibit A: In the past month alone, [Target] has missed 8 deadlines. Not close calls - full misses.

Exhibit B: When confronted about Exhibit A, [Target] blamed 'unclear communication,' which is fascinating because the deadlines were in writing, with date stamps, sent to their email, which they confirmed receiving.

Exhibit C: This pattern extends back 3 years. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this isn't a bug - it's a feature. This is systematic avoidance raised to performance art.

Exhibit D: The most damaging evidence is this: [Target] is actually quite competent at things they care about. They respond instantly to social plans, never miss happy hour, always remember fantasy football. The incompetence is selective. It's weaponized."

### Step 3: Anticipate Defense (Rebuttal)

**Legal parallel:** Anticipating and dismantling defense arguments

**Purpose:** Address what they might say in their defense, then destroy it. Shows you've thought of everything.

**Structure:**
```
"The defense might argue [possible defense]. But [reason this defense fails]. In fact, [turn defense into additional evidence of guilt]."
```

**Comedy adaptation:**
- Inhabit defense attorney role briefly (voice change optional)
- Present most sympathetic defense possible
- Systematically destroy it
- Show that even their best defense makes it worse

**Example:**
"Now, the defense might argue: 'My client is just disorganized! They mean well!'

Let me address this directly. First, meaning well without delivering results is called 'failing.' Second, as I established in Exhibit D, they're perfectly organized when it comes to things they care about. And third - and this is crucial - even if we accept the 'disorganized' defense, that means they're aware of this flaw and have done nothing to fix it. That's not an excuse; that's a confession.

The defense might also claim: 'Everyone makes mistakes!'

Everyone does make mistakes. But mistakes are random. This pattern is consistent. If you're consistently late, consistently unprepared, consistently making the same 'mistake,' that's not a mistake - that's a strategy."

### Step 4: Deliver Verdict (Closing Argument)

**Legal parallel:** Closing argument and sentencing

**Purpose:** Tie everything together, restate the most damaging points, deliver the final blow.

**Structure:**
```
"Ladies and gentlemen, the evidence is clear: [restate accusation with strongest language]. We've established [key point 1], proven [key point 2], and demonstrated [key point 3].

The verdict is obvious: [guilty of specific charge].

Sentencing recommendation: [absurd punishment that comments on character]."
```

**Comedy adaptation:**
- Adopt formal "ladies and gentlemen" address
- Summarize case efficiently (don't repeat everything)
- Announce verdict with authority
- Make "sentencing" reveal character flaw or include callback

**Example:**
"Ladies and gentlemen, we've proven beyond any reasonable doubt that [Target] is guilty of weaponized incompetence in the first degree. We've established a pattern spanning years, demonstrated selective competence proving capacity, and dismantled every possible defense.

The verdict: Guilty. Guilty of exploiting other people's professionalism. Guilty of mistaking tolerance for approval. Guilty of being the person everyone has to work around.

Sentencing: [Target] is hereby sentenced to be exactly who they are - someone competent people avoid, whose reputation precedes them, who will spend the rest of their career wondering why they never get the good projects. The punishment is being themselves. No further penalty necessary."

### Step 5: Optional - Appeal Denied (Callback)

**Legal parallel:** Appeals process

**Purpose:** If target tries to defend themselves or situation continues, you can "deny the appeal"

**Structure:**
```
"The defendant has filed an appeal claiming [new excuse]. Appeal denied. [Reason why new excuse also fails]."
```

**Example:**
"Update: The defendant has filed an appeal claiming they've 'changed' and are 'working on it.' Appeal denied. 'Working on it' isn't a defense - it's an admission of guilt with a promise you won't keep. Court adjourned."

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Insufficient evidence provided | Ask: "I need specific behaviors or facts to build exhibits. What has [target] actually done?" |
| Target is vulnerable population | Refuse: "I can't prosecute [vulnerable group]. Try public figure or consenting participant." |
| Accusation too vague | Clarify: "What specific charge? 'Being bad' isn't actionable. Try 'incompetence,' 'hypocrisy,' 'narcissism,' etc." |
| Multiple possible accusations | Offer: "I see evidence for [accusation A] and [accusation B]. Which should I prosecute?" |
| Request for actual legal advice | Clarify: "This is comedy structure, not legal advice. For real legal issues, consult an attorney." |
| Evidence doesn't support accusation | Respond: "The evidence supports [different accusation] better. Adjust charge or provide different evidence?" |

## Examples

### Example 1: The Lazy Coworker (Full Prosecution)

**Input:**
```
target: "Coworker who never meets deadlines"
accusation: "Weaponized incompetence"
evidence: ["Misses deadlines", "Good at personal tasks", "Blames others"]
length: "full prosecution"
```

**Output:**

**OPENING STATEMENT:**

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we are here to prosecute [Name] for weaponized incompetence with aggravating factors of selective competence and blame-shifting. The state will prove that the defendant has systematically failed at work-related tasks while demonstrating perfect competence in personal matters, establishing beyond reasonable doubt that this is a choice, not a deficiency.

**EVIDENCE:**

**Exhibit A:** In the past six months, the defendant has missed 12 deadlines. Not "close calls" - full misses. These are not surprise deadlines. These are established timelines, agreed upon in writing, with multiple reminders.

**Exhibit B:** When confronted about missed deadlines, the defendant consistently blames external factors: "unclear instructions," "too much on my plate," "didn't realize it was urgent." However, investigation reveals that instructions were in writing, workload was comparable to colleagues who succeeded, and urgency was explicitly stated.

**Exhibit C:** Here's where it gets interesting. The defendant demonstrates perfect competence in non-work domains. Fantasy football lineup? Updated every week without fail. Social plans? Never missed. Personal errands during work hours? Always completed successfully.

**Exhibit D:** The most damaging evidence: When assigned tasks that directly benefit the defendant (vacation request forms, reimbursement paperwork, documentation for their own recognition), these are completed immediately with perfect accuracy. The incompetence is selective. It targets tasks that benefit others or the organization.

**REBUTTAL TO DEFENSE:**

The defense will likely argue: "My client is simply disorganized and overwhelmed!"

Ladies and gentlemen, Exhibit C and D demolish this defense. The defendant is perfectly organized when it serves their interests. This isn't disorganization - it's prioritization that places their convenience above all obligations.

The defense may also claim: "Everyone struggles with deadlines!"

True. But everyone doesn't have a 100% miss rate on work deadlines and a 100% success rate on personal tasks. That's not struggle - that's strategy.

**CLOSING ARGUMENT:**

Ladies and gentlemen, the evidence is overwhelming. We've established a pattern of systematic work failure, proven selective competence, and demonstrated deliberate blame-shifting. This isn't someone who struggles - this is someone who has calculated that "struggling" gets them out of responsibilities.

**VERDICT:**

Guilty of weaponized incompetence in the first degree.

**SENTENCING:**

The defendant is sentenced to exactly what they've created: a reputation. They will be the person no one wants on their team, the name that makes project managers wince, the colleague people work around rather than with. They've built this reputation one missed deadline at a time. The punishment is being who they've chosen to be. Court adjourned.

### Example 2: Tech CEO (Compressed Paragraph)

**Input:**
```
target: "Tech CEO with 5 failed startups"
accusation: "Serial fraud disguised as innovation"
length: "paragraph"
```

**Output:**

**The Case Against [Tech CEO]:**

The state prosecutes [Name] for fraud in the first degree - specifically, obtaining investor funds under false pretenses while calling it "disruption." Evidence: Exhibit A: Five consecutive startup failures with identical patterns (overpromise, underdeliver, blame market timing). Exhibit B: $100M+ in total funding across ventures with zero profitable exits. Exhibit C: Each pitch deck contains phrases like "revolutionary," "game-changing," and "first-mover advantage" - none of which materialized. Exhibit D: The defendant has learned nothing from failures, as evidenced by identical pitch for sixth startup currently underway. The defense will claim "entrepreneurship requires risk." Rebuttal: Risk requires some possibility of success. Five failures isn't risk-taking - it's a pattern proving the defendant's only skill is fundraising from people too polite to check references. Verdict: Guilty of serial incompetence disguised as vision. Sentencing: Six months of actual employment with deliverables and accountability - basically, hell for someone who's never been held responsible for results.

### Example 3: Influencer (Rapid-Fire Legal)

**Input:**
```
target: "Influencer who faked charity work"
accusation: "Moral fraud"
length: "rapid-fire"
```

**Output:**

Let's prosecute [Name] for moral fraud with aggravating factors of shamelessness. Charge: Faking charity work for engagement metrics. Evidence: Exhibit A: Staged photos with "people you're helping" who you paid to pose. Exhibit B: "Charity" doesn't exist as registered organization. Exhibit C: When exposed, you doubled down instead of apologizing. Exhibit D: This wasn't a mistake - it was a calculated marketing campaign. Defense: "I raised awareness!" Rebuttal: You raised awareness that you're a sociopath with good lighting. Verdict: Guilty of being the reason people don't trust influencers. Sentencing: Permanent label as the person who pretended to care about human suffering for Instagram likes - that's your legacy now. Case closed.

---

### Example 4: Friend Who's Always Late (Self-Aware Version)

**Input:**
```
target: "Friend who's chronically late"
accusation: "Narcissism disguised as disorganization"
evidence: ["Always late", "No apologies", "Makes excuses"]
include: "self-awareness"
```

**Output:**

**The Prosecution of [Friend]:**

Look, I know I'm about to prosecute my friend for being late, which seems harsh. But we're building a legal case because that's funnier than just saying "you suck at time management." So here we go.

**Charge:** First-degree narcissism masked as poor time management.

**Evidence:**
- Exhibit A: You've been late to 47 out of 50 hangouts. That's 94% - that's not disorganization, that's consistency.
- Exhibit B: You never apologize when you arrive late. You explain. There's a difference. Apologies acknowledge the other person. Explanations justify yourself.
- Exhibit C: Your excuses are creative but impossible: "Traffic was bad" (we checked, it wasn't), "I thought we said 8:30" (texts prove we said 8:00), "I couldn't find parking" (you were 30 minutes late to a video call).

**Defense Anticipated:** "I'm just bad with time!"

**Rebuttal:** You're never late to things you actually prioritize. Job interviews? On time. First dates? Early. Free food events? You're helping set up. The "bad with time" defense is really "bad at valuing your time."

**Verdict:** Guilty of weaponized tardiness.

**Sentencing:** We're going to start lying to you about start times, which means you've successfully trained your friends to be dishonest. Congratulations - your punishment is knowing everyone has to manage around you like you're a child. That's the sentence.

I'm not saying this is too harsh... wait, no, I am saying it's harsh. But you've earned it. Court adjourned.

## Integration with Greg Giraldo Expert

This skill embodies Giraldo's Harvard Law background - structuring roasts like legal arguments. When the greg-giraldo expert uses this skill, maintain:

**Voice Elements:**
- Legal terminology used naturally, not pretentiously
- Systematic destruction through logical progression
- Authority in delivery (you're the prosecutor, they're on trial)
- Self-awareness when getting too dark

**Strategic Elements:**
- Build evidence like building a case in court
- Anticipate and destroy defenses (lawyer's training)
- Make verdict feel inevitable (preponderance of evidence)
- Use legal structure to extend roast while maintaining focus

**Giraldo would say:**
"When you structure a roast like a legal argument, you're not just insulting them - you're proving they deserve it. By the time you reach the verdict, the audience isn't just laughing, they're nodding. You've made the case. That's the difference between 'you suck' and 'here's the documented evidence of exactly how and why you suck.' One is an opinion. The other is a prosecution."
